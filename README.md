# Big Data W1D1

Write a Java program to accomplish the following tasks. Please submit Java program and test run on the file attached.

Given a text-file input123,

1. The program will extract each “word” and form a key-value pair (you MUST create a pair class) where the key is the “word” and value is integer one.  Note that your program should treat Cat and cat as the same word.
2. Each pair is inserted into a List (of pairs).
3. Output the List
4. Note that tokens such as input123, abc.txt,  a23bc and abc_ptr  are not words. However, key-value is two words.
5. **As a good programming habit, you want to use generics.**
6. **Please do not use Streams.**
7. **Please do not use Hashmap.**
8. **You must create "Pair" objects.**
